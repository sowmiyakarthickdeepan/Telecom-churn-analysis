In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n",

That's why, I took the Churned customer data to find out the reason or churning behaviour and the pattern. Then, I experimented with different logics to extract some insights. I created some new columns like International, evening, day & night call duration as well as international, day, night, evening call rate per minute. Again, I figured out those have taken voice mail plan but not using it and sending less no. of voice mails but talking more durations might be facing some network issues as I myself experienced that voice mssg need some more network stability to be sent.
